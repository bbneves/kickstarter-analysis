# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for a future play project.

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

###### Louise wanted to do an simple analysis on the Kickstarter Database. 
	

### Purpose

###### In order to achieve the best outcome, BBNs Analytical ran some analysis to find best funding prices and dates.


## Analysis and Challenges

###### Based on the result tha Louise's play is getting from BBNs Analytical. She asked to find how different campaings did in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

###### The results shows: May and June are the best months to launch a Kicktarter related to **Theater**.
###### The third trimester of the year should be avoided because there is a higher risk of not achieving the fund goal.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

###### The results shows: Plays funding goals below USD 5,000 have an increased chance to succeed. The range from USD 5,000 and USD 10,000 is riskier but achievable. Goals above USD 15,000 should be avoided. 
###### Some success rates in the USD 35,000 and USD 45,000 may be considered as outliers. Because the amount of data samples in this range is too low to create a safe estimate.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

####### According to some plays: only a few backers (around 100) are necessary to meet the goal. 
The difficulties will be keeping the cost of the play low in order to increase the chance of achieving the pledged amount. it is possible to go over the total, therefore a lower goal will not keep Louise's play form getting an higher amount of funds.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

#### Best Launch Dates: March and June
#### Worst Launch Dates: November, December and January

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

#### Goal range up to USD 5,000 have the highest success rates. USD 10,000 goals have some challenge but the success rate is still above 50%.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

#### The projects categories are fairly broad, which may include projects that not necessarily fit the category.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

#### A duration chart based on outcome and goals.
